## Places (helior dot info)
> "Oh the places you'll go!" — Dr. Seuss

"Places" is a website for demonstrating some of the more interesting landscapes and interiors I have visited around the world. The visuals are represented as interactive 360° panoramic images. I hope you enjoy it!

##### Technology
- Build using a node.js-based static-generator called [Metalsmith](http://metalsmith.io/)
- 360° panoramic sphere is build using [Three.js](http://threejs.org/)
- Images that wrap around the geometric sphere are generated by using the [Microsoft PhotoSynth](https://photosynth.net/) app on my mobile phone
- Deployed via [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/) and generously hosted for free using [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/)

###### Nice-to-have TODOs:
- use grab/grabbing cursors when interacting with images
- use metalsmith-convert to auto-optimize images (and produce thumbnails for main navigation)
